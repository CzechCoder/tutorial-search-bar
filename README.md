# Search Bar that needs to be clicked - tutorial project

## Quick start

1.  **Install dependecies**

    - use "pnpm install" or install the packages with any package delivery service of your choice

    - use "npm run dev" both in web and server folder to run frontend and backend

    - for the list of installed packages see dependencies and devDependencies in `package.json` in each folder

2.  **Start using the web**

    - you can simply type a name or any part of a name to initiate the search

    - the data is hardcoded in the backend, therefore there is next to no delay

    - if there is no match, there will be a note in the place where the results should be

    - if you search for an empty string, the backend will return all the users

    !!! for extra challenge you can try to fetch the data from a database and use the query states and a spinner to indicate the data being downloaded, or display an error if there is problem with the connection !!!
